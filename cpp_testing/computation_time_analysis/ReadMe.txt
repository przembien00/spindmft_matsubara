Analysis of the Computation time of the Algorithm DMFT_selfcons_TTI

1) A linear dependency between sample size M and computation time is found 
2) the computation time increases quadratically with the number of time steps

The python-file "compute_CT.py" captures the dependencies and is able to 
approximately predict the computation time for given numerical parameters.
